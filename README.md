## About

This repository is a quick way to demo the SQL queries for the DotAlign code challenge.

## Challenge

Given the documented database tables (with some sample data) write a SQL query that...
1. ... lists of each domain in the system
2. ... lists of each email address along with the ownerâ€™s real name
3. ... lists each domain and the total number of emails sent to it (combining To, CC, & BCC)

## Installation

In terminal
clone this repository with `git clone 'git@github.com:SammySteiner/dot-align-sql.git'`  
cd into this directory `cd dot-align-sql`  
While using a mac: 
if you do not have an up-to-date version of Ruby, run `brew install ruby`  
if you do not have the bundler gem installed, run  `gem install bundler`  
run `bundle install` to install the required gems  
run `ruby bin/create_and_seed_db.rb` to create and seed the Database  
You're now ready to test out the query files. If you're using Windows, reach out and we'll find a way to set you up to run these files.


## Testing

To view a printout in terminal of the sql queries, input the following commands:
1. ruby lib/sql_query_one.rb
2. ruby lib/sql_query_two.rb
3. ruby lib/sql_query_three.rb

## SQL

The SQL queries for each of the challenges are:
1. SELECT * FROM domain;
2. SELECT email_address.address_text, person.name  
FROM email_address  
JOIN person ON email_address.person_id == person.id;
3. SELECT domain.url_text, COUNT(*) as total_sent  
FROM domain  
JOIN email_address ON domain.id == email_address.domain_id  
JOIN participant ON email_address.id == participant.email_address_id  
WHERE  participant.participant_type_id == 2  
OR participant.participant_type_id == 3  
OR participant.participant_type_id == 4  
GROUP BY domain.url_text;
